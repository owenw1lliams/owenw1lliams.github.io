# Why The Dark Web Is More Secure, And Safer, Than The Clear Net

Most people think of the “darknet” as a dark, mysterious and dangerous place on the internet, where only illegal or illicit things happen. This is simply not true.

The “darknet” comes in a few different forms, the most popular, and the one I will be talking about, being “TOR” or “The Onion Router”, a reference to the technique it uses to function. 

The TOR Project is a nonprofit organization whose aim is to provide internet privacy, anonymity, and a censorship free internet to all. On their website they explain the motives around making the TOR project, I urge anyone interested to read it, and support the project. https://www.torproject.org/about/history/ 

TOR uses something called onion routing, this is the idea of routing user traffic through multiple ‘nodes’ or layers before reaching its final destination. These nodes are hosted by regular people on something as small and inconspicuous as a Raspberry Pi, making it very difficult to track the IP addresses, and therefore identities, of TOR users. Onion routing was the first way of making a decentralized network that would be privacy protecting, and not majority controlled by any major corporation or government. In fact, in 2019, the BBC announced an onion site for international users, and later Ukrainians and Russians respectively. A link to their article with more information can be found here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50150981 Something you may notice about onion sites, is they dont use standard domain extensions, for example “.com” or “.org”, instead they use “.onion”. They use long and complex domain names, this is because, unlike the clearnet, all traffic going through TOR is encrypted, which means that people hosting nodes or your ISP (internet service provider), in theory, cannot see anything that you are doing when using TOR.

So, why is it more secure, and safer? Well, the internet will never be safe, no matter what government legislation, regulation or changes are made to the idea as a whole. Something like TOR is not a magic bullet for normal people, nor criminals alike. It is still traceable, and it is still vulnerable to attack. As  demonstrated through the group ‘KAX17’ which deployed around 900 nodes in an attempt to de-anonymize TOR users in 2019. They were rumored to be the German government however it is unlikely this will ever be confirmed. More information on KAX17 can be found here: https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/12/was-threat-actor-kax17-de-anonymizing-the-tor-network. 

Although the internet will never be safe, and as soon as you type something into your search browser, you are at a point of no return, TOR uses the best efforts of a strong and passionate community of developers and users, to give some security and privacy back to the people who need it most. For most people, TOR is not something they would use on a daily basis due to its slow browsing speeds, caused by jumping through nodes. However to people like whistleblowers, journalists and activists with higher threat models, TOR is not just a browser it could be baked into their operating system, a tool for finding the truth, or a means of communication. 

Now to address the elephant in the room. Yes, illegal, disgusting, and horrible things happen on the TOR network. But can’t the same thing be said for the clearnet? Take the YouTube cat killer (https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/netflix-air-doc-youtube-killer-21033404), or the terrabytes of leaked personal information that is shared on clearnet forums on a daily basis, defunked examples include; RaidForums and BreachedForums both earning their owners and users millions in fortune. Or what about the illegal, warrantless, mass surveillence that is conducted under the guise of “protecting children” and “national security” by every government in the world, helped by mega corporations, and software that has been developed specifically, by western countries, to aid their mass surveillence dystopia. Exposed by the Snowden leaks of 2013: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mass-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rules. Or the fact mega corporations and big tech are allowed to sell petabytes of user data to data brokers, and traded by other mega corporations and even political parties (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44793247). The list goes on. 

The internet will never be safe, no matter what side you believe you are looking at.
